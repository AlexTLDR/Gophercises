The purpose of this exercise is to build a queryable command-line game store:
In the 1st step, the data is loaded into the game store as structs.
In the 2nd step it is added an interface for listing the games.
In the 3rd step an "id" command was added so the users can query the games by id.
In the 4th step was added a "save" command to encode the games to json.
In the last step the initial data was moved in a json and the program read it from there.
